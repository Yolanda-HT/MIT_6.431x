## Common Types of Distributions
### Continuous
Distribution | Link | Description 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Gaussian (Normal) Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) | Central limit theorem: the average of samples of random variables with finite mean and variance converge to normal distribution.
Continuous Uniform Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution) | All intervals of the same length on the distribution's support are equally probable.
Gamma Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) | Parameterized by shape parameter k and a scale parameter θ. The exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and chi-square distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution.
Exponential Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) | Probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. 
Chi-square Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution) | Chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables.
Cauchy Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution) | The Cauchy distribution f(x;x_0, gamma) is the distribution of the x-intercept of a ray issuing from (x_0, gamma) with a uniformly distributed angle. It is also the distribution of the ratio of two independent normally distributed random variables with mean zero.
Student t Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) | Student's t-distribution is any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arise when estimating the mean of a normally-distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population's standard deviation is unknown.
Laplace Distribution| [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution) | It can be thought of as two exponential distributions (with an additional location parameter) spliced together back-to-back, although the term is also sometimes used to refer to the Gumbel distribution. 
Negative Binomial Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution) | Models the number of successes in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified (non-random) number of failures (denoted r) occurs.
Beta Distribution | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) | The beta distribution has been applied to model the behavior of random variables limited to intervals of finite length in a wide variety of disciplines.
